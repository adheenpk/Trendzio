# Trendzio
Trendzio is a Django-based e-commerce website project I built by following a YouTube tutorial. It features user authentication, product listing, shopping cart functionality, and order confirmation. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Djangoâ€™s core features, including models, views, templates, and basic CRUD operations.
